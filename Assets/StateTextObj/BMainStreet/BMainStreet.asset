  stateStory: "Past the entrance is the main street. The dirt path fades away far
    into the distant land, rising and falling across the hills.\r\nMost of the houses
    are reduced to rubbles. Only a few are left standing on it\u2019s last support
    columns.\r\nOn your right is a storage shed.\r\nYou notice a door to an underground
    bunker on the far end of the street.\r\n"
