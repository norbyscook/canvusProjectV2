  stateStory: "You walk to the bunker, open the door, and walk down the dark passageway.
    The light slowly fades away,  and it becomes pitch black. You feel your way around.
    You wished you had a flashlight.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the stairs, there seems
    to be a locked door. \r\nYou sense a faint glow coming from the left. You see
    a faint green light coming from a second door at the end of another hallway.
    It is a thick metal door with a bulky round window. \r\n"
